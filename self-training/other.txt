    Resource-oriented Controller !

    DispatcherServlet consults one or more handler mappings
    In order to know which controller to dispatch a request to
    Spring comes with a handful of handler mapping implementations to choose from, including

     BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping
        Maps controllers to URLs that are based on the controllers’ bean names.

     ControllerBeanNameHandlerMapping
        Similar to BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping,
        In this case, the bean names are n’t required to follow URL conventions.

     ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping
        Maps controllers to URLs by using the controllers’ class names as the basis for their URLs.

     DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping
        Maps request to controller and controller methods that are annotated with @RequestMapping.

     SimpleUrlHandlerMapping
        Maps controllers to URLs using a property collection defined in the Spring application context.
